# Logo Setup Instructions

## Adding Your Project Soch Logo

To use your custom Project Soch logo in the website:

1. **Save the logo image** as `logo.png` in the `public/images/` folder
   - The logo should be in PNG format for best quality with transparency
   - Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or similar square dimensions
   - The image will be automatically resized to fit the navigation bar

2. **File Location**: `public/images/logo.png`

3. **Automatic Fallback**: If the logo image fails to load, the website will automatically fall back to the text-based logo with the heart icon

## Current Integration

The logo has been integrated into:
- ✅ **Navigation Bar** (top of every page)
- ✅ **Footer** (bottom of every page)
- ✅ **Responsive design** (works on desktop, tablet, and mobile)
- ✅ **Fallback system** (shows text logo if image fails)

## Logo Specifications

- **Height**: 2.5rem (40px) in the navigation
- **Width**: Auto (maintains aspect ratio)
- **Format**: PNG recommended (supports transparency)
- **Background**: Should work on both light and dark backgrounds

## Next Steps

1. Save your Project Soch logo as `public/images/logo.png`
2. Refresh the website to see the logo appear
3. The logo will automatically replace the current heart icon + text combination

Your logo with the orange figure reaching for a star and the progress bars will look great in the navigation!
