# 🔧 GitHub Pages Fix Required

## 🚨 Issue Found:
Your GitHub Pages site at https://maria715.github.io/projectsoch/ is showing a **301 redirect** instead of your website.

## 🔍 Root Cause:
The **custom domain setting** in GitHub Pages is still active, causing a redirect loop:
- GitHub Pages redirects to `projectsoch.eu`
- But `projectsoch.eu` DNS still points to old hosting
- Creates redirect loop → blank page

---

## 🎯 Immediate Fix Required:

### Step 1: Remove Custom Domain (Temporarily)
**Go to GitHub Pages settings**:
1. **Visit**: https://github.com/Maria715/projectsoch/settings/pages
2. **Find**: "Custom domain" section
3. **Clear**: Delete `projectsoch.eu` from the field
4. **Save**: Click save to remove custom domain
5. **Wait**: 2-5 minutes for GitHub to update

### Step 2: Test GitHub Pages URL
After removing custom domain:
- **Visit**: https://maria715.github.io/projectsoch/
- **Should show**: Your Project Soch website
- **This confirms**: Website is working, just DNS issue

### Step 3: Re-add Custom Domain Later
**Only after your nameservers switch to GoDaddy**:
1. **Check nameservers**: `nslookup -type=ns projectsoch.eu`
2. **When GoDaddy nameservers**: Add DNS records in GoDaddy
3. **Then re-add**: `projectsoch.eu` in GitHub Pages settings

---

## 🔄 Why This Happens:

### The Redirect Loop:
1. **User visits**: maria715.github.io/projectsoch/
2. **GitHub redirects**: to projectsoch.eu (because custom domain is set)
3. **DNS resolves**: to old hosting (because nameservers haven't switched)
4. **Old hosting**: Doesn't have your website
5. **Result**: Blank page or error

### The Solution:
**Temporarily remove custom domain** until DNS points to GitHub correctly.

## 📋 Action Plan:

### Immediate (5 minutes):
- [ ] **Remove custom domain** from GitHub Pages settings
- [ ] **Test GitHub URL**: Should show your website
- [ ] **Confirm website works**: At maria715.github.io/projectsoch/

### Later (After nameserver switch):

- [ ] **Re-add custom domain** in GitHub Pages
- [ ] **Enable HTTPS**: Once DNS is correct

---

## 🎯 Expected Results:

### After Removing Custom Domain:
- **✅ https://maria715.github.io/projectsoch/**: Shows your Project Soch website
- **✅ All features work**: Contact forms, WhatsApp integration, etc.
- **✅ Team photos visible**: Arslan, Maria, Saqib

### After DNS Switch + Re-adding Domain:
- **✅ https://projectsoch.eu**: Shows your website
- **✅ HTTPS enabled**: Secure connection
- **✅ Custom domain working**: Professional URL

## 🆘 Priority Action:

**Go to GitHub Pages settings RIGHT NOW and remove the custom domain temporarily.**

This will immediately fix the blank page issue and let you see your website working at the GitHub URL while we wait for the nameserver switch to complete.

**Your website IS working - it's just the redirect causing the problem! 🚀**
