## 🌐 Setting Up Your Custom Domain

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages Settings
1. **Go to your GitHub repository**: https://github.com/makht/project-soch-website
2. **Click "Settings"** (in the repository menu)
3. **Scroll to "Pages"** (in the left sidebar)
4. **In "Custom domain"** field, enter your domain (e.g., `projectsoch.org`)
5. **Check "Enforce HTTPS"** (recommended)
6. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Create CNAME File (Automatic)
GitHub will automatically create a CNAME file in your repository with your domain name.

### Step 3: Configure DNS at Your Domain Provider
At your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.), add these DNS records:

#### Option A: Using A Records (Recommended)
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A  
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @  
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: makht.github.io
```

#### Option B: Using CNAME (Alternative)
