## ðŸ”§ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Build and Test Locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm install -g serve
serve -s build
```

### 2. Update Configuration:
- Ensure all image paths use `%PUBLIC_URL%` or relative paths
- Check that all links work in production build
- Verify favicon and manifest.json paths

### 3. Environment Variables:
If you have any API keys or environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file with:
REACT_APP_API_URL=your-api-url
```

---

## ðŸ“‹ DNS Configuration

### For most hosting providers, you'll need to set:

#### A Records:
```
@ â†’ [Your hosting IP address]
www â†’ [Your hosting IP address]
```

#### Or CNAME Records (for services like Netlify):
```
@ â†’ your-site.netlify.app
www â†’ your-site.netlify.app
```
