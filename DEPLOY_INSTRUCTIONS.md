---

## 🌟 RECOMMENDED: Netlify Deployment (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Netlify
1. Visit **netlify.com**
2. Click **"Get started for free"**
3. Sign up with email or GitHub

### Step 2: Deploy Your Site
1. Click **"Add new site"** → **"Deploy manually"**
2. **Drag and drop** your entire `build` folder onto the deploy area
3. Wait 30 seconds for deployment
4. You'll get a URL like: `https://amazing-name-123.netlify.app`

### Step 3: Add Your Custom Domain
1. Go to **Site settings** → **Domain management**
2. Click **"Add custom domain"**
3. Enter your domain name (e.g., `projectsoch.org`)
4. Netlify will show you DNS settings to configure

### Step 4: Configure DNS (at your domain provider)
Add these DNS records at your domain registrar:

**For Netlify:**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [your-netlify-subdomain].netlify.app

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5
```

**OR use Netlify's nameservers** (easier):
- Netlify will provide nameservers like:
  - `dns1.p03.nsone.net`
  - `dns2.p03.nsone.net`
  - etc.
