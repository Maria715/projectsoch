# üîç Issue Analysis for ProjectSoch.eu

## üö® Issues Identified:

### Issue 1: GitHub Pages Configuration Problem
From your screenshot, I can see:
- **Your site is live at**: http://projectsoch.eu/ (HTTP, not HTTPS)
- **Last deployed**: 11 minutes ago by Maria715
- **Branch**: Building from `main` branch
- **Custom domain section**: Cut off in screenshot, but likely has issues

### Issue 2: Nameservers Haven't Switched Yet
**Current nameservers**: Still Cloudflare
- `harlan.ns.cloudflare.com`
- `roxy.ns.cloudflare.com`

**Expected**: Should be GoDaddy nameservers like:
- `ns01.domaincontrol.com`
- `ns02.domaincontrol.com`

### Issue 3: DNS Still Points to Old Hosting
**Current IPs**:
- `172.67.210.45` (Cloudflare)
- `104.21.93.131` (Cloudflare)

**Should be GitHub Pages IPs**:
- `185.199.108.153`
- `185.199.109.153`
- etc.

---

## üîß Root Cause:

### The nameserver switch you made in GoDaddy hasn't propagated yet.
- **You changed**: Nameservers to GoDaddy
- **But DNS still resolves**: Through Cloudflare
- **Result**: Still shows "Coming Soon" page from old hosting

---

## üéØ Immediate Solutions:

### Option 1: Fix in GitHub Pages Settings (Quick)
**In your GitHub Pages settings** (where you took the screenshot):

1. **Scroll down** to "Custom domain" section
2. **Enter**: `projectsoch.eu`
3. **Save** the setting
4. **Wait for DNS check** (GitHub will verify domain)

### Option 2: Fix Branch Source
**Your site is building from `main` branch**, but GitHub Pages typically uses `gh-pages` branch:

1. **In GitHub Pages settings**:
   - **Source**: Change to "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: Select `gh-pages` (not main)
   - **Folder**: / (root)
   - **Save**

---

## üöÄ Quick Fix Steps:

### Step 1: Update GitHub Pages Settings
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/Maria715/projectsoch/settings/pages
2. **Custom domain**: Enter `projectsoch.eu`
3. **Source**: Select "Deploy from a branch"
4. **Branch**: Select `gh-pages` (created when you ran npm run deploy)
5. **Save changes**

### Step 2: Redeploy to Ensure Correct Branch
```bash
npm run deploy
```

### Step 3: Wait for DNS (Still Need This)
The nameserver switch to GoDaddy will still take 2-24 hours, but GitHub Pages might work once configured correctly.

---

## üîç Why You See HTTP Not HTTPS:

**GitHub Pages shows**: `http://projectsoch.eu/`
**Problem**: HTTPS isn't enabled yet because:
1. **Custom domain** not properly configured in GitHub settings
2. **DNS verification** failed (domain still points to Cloudflare)
3. **SSL certificate** can't be issued until DNS is correct

---

## üìã Checklist to Fix:

### Immediate (5 minutes):
- [ ] **GitHub Pages settings**: Add projectsoch.eu as custom domain
- [ ] **Source branch**: Set to gh-pages (not main)
- [ ] **Redeploy**: Run `npm run deploy`

### After Nameserver Propagation (2-24 hours):
- [ ] **Verify nameservers**: Should show domaincontrol.com
- [ ] **Add DNS records**: In GoDaddy (the A records I mentioned)
- [ ] **Enable HTTPS**: In GitHub Pages settings

---

## üéØ Expected Results:

### After GitHub Settings Fix:
- **GitHub Pages**: Should show proper configuration
- **Domain verification**: Will start working when DNS propagates

### After DNS Propagation:
- **https://projectsoch.eu**: Will show your Project Soch website
- **HTTPS**: Will be automatically enabled
- **"Coming Soon" page**: Will be replaced

---

## üÜò What You Should Do Right Now:

### 1. Fix GitHub Pages Settings:
- **Add custom domain**: projectsoch.eu
- **Set correct branch**: gh-pages
- **Save settings**

### 2. Wait for Nameserver Switch:
- **Check every few hours**: `nslookup -type=ns projectsoch.eu`
- **Look for**: GoDaddy nameservers

### 3. Then Add DNS Records:
- **In GoDaddy**: Add the GitHub Pages A records
- **Wait for propagation**: 1-6 hours
- **Website goes live**

**The main issue is that your nameserver switch is still propagating, but we can fix the GitHub Pages configuration right now! üöÄ**
