# üöÄ ProjectSoch.eu Domain Setup

## ‚úÖ Deployment Status: SUCCESS!

Your Project Soch website has been deployed with custom domain configuration for **projectsoch.eu**.

---

## üåê Current Status from https://projectsoch.eu/:
Based on your domain, it currently shows "Bald geht's los" (Coming Soon in German), which means you have hosting but need to configure it to point to GitHub Pages.

---

## üîß DNS Configuration Required

### Step 1: GitHub Pages Settings
1. **Go to**: https://github.com/makht/project-soch-website/settings/pages
2. **Custom domain**: Should now show `projectsoch.eu` (auto-configured)
3. **Enforce HTTPS**: ‚úÖ Enable this
4. **Wait for DNS check**: GitHub will verify your domain

### Step 2: Configure DNS at Your Domain Provider

Since your domain is **projectsoch.eu**, you need to update DNS records at your domain registrar:

#### **Replace current DNS with GitHub Pages IPs:**

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: makht.github.io
```

#### **Remove any existing A records** that point to your current hosting provider.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:

### Current Hosting Conflict:
Your domain currently points to a different hosting service (showing the German "Coming Soon" page). You need to:

1. **Either**: Update DNS to point to GitHub Pages (recommended)
2. **Or**: Upload your built website files to your current hosting provider

### Recommended Approach: Use GitHub Pages
- **Free hosting** ‚úÖ
- **Automatic HTTPS** ‚úÖ  
- **Global CDN** ‚úÖ
- **Easy updates** with `npm run deploy` ‚úÖ

## üìã Step-by-Step DNS Update:

### Find Your Domain Provider:
Check where you registered **projectsoch.eu** (common providers: Namecheap, GoDaddy, Cloudflare, etc.)

### Update DNS Records:
1. **Login** to your domain provider
2. **Find DNS settings** (usually called "DNS Management" or "Nameservers")
3. **Delete existing A records** pointing to current hosting
4. **Add the 4 GitHub Pages A records** listed above
5. **Add CNAME record** for www subdomain
6. **Save changes**

### Wait for Propagation:
- **DNS changes**: Take 1-48 hours to propagate worldwide
- **GitHub verification**: Will show green checkmark when ready
- **HTTPS**: Will be enabled automatically once DNS is verified

---

## üîç How to Check Progress:

### 1. GitHub Pages Status:
Visit: https://github.com/makht/project-soch-website/settings/pages
- Look for green checkmark next to your domain
- Any errors will be shown here

### 2. DNS Propagation:
Use online tools like:
- whatsmydns.net
- dnschecker.org
Enter `projectsoch.eu` to see if GitHub IPs are propagating

### 3. Website Status:
- **Currently**: https://projectsoch.eu shows "Coming Soon"
- **After DNS update**: Will show your Project Soch website
- **Timeline**: 1-48 hours for full propagation
